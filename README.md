# Ansible Role: Bind9 DNS Forwarder for Raspberry Pi

This Ansible role configures a Bind9 DNS server as a DNS forwarder on Raspberry Pi. It's designed to help set up and manage a simple DNS forwarding service, directing DNS queries from the local network to upstream DNS servers for resolution.

## Features

- **Automated Setup:** Fully automated configuration of Bind9 on a Raspberry Pi using Ansible.
- **DNS Forwarding:** Set up Bind9 as a DNS forwarder, forwarding DNS requests to specified upstream DNS servers.
- **Customizable:** Ability to customize forwarder addresses, domain configurations, and other DNS settings.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource consumption, ideal for Raspberry Pi devices running in small networks.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with a compatible OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS).
- Ansible installed on the control machine.
- Root or sudo privileges on the Raspberry Pi.

## Role Variables

Available variables for customization are located in the `defaults/main.yml` file. Below are the key variables:

```yaml
# Upstream DNS servers for forwarding requests
dns_forwarders:
  - "8.8.8.8"
  - "8.8.4.4"

# The interface Bind9 will listen on
bind_interfaces:
  - "eth0"

# DNS domain options (optional)
dns_domain: "example.com"
```

You can override these variables by defining them in your playbook or providing them in your inventory.

## Example Playbook

Hereâ€™s a basic playbook to apply this role:

```yaml

      vars:
        dns_forwarders:
          - "1.1.1.1"
          - "9.9.9.9"
        bind_interfaces:
          - "eth0"
        dns_domain: "myhome.local"
```
